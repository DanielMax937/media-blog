# Demo Files

This directory contains auto-generated HTML demo files created by the Medium blog generation strategy.

## Usage

When a technical blog post is generated using the Medium strategy, if the content is detected as technical, an interactive HTML demo will be:
1. Generated by the AI
2. Saved to this directory with a timestamp-based filename
3. Accessible via `/demos/[filename].html` in the browser

## Files

All `.html` files in this directory are auto-generated and git-ignored. They are created dynamically during blog generation and can be safely deleted.

## Access

Files in this directory are publicly accessible via:
```
http://localhost:3000/demos/demo-[timestamp].html
```
